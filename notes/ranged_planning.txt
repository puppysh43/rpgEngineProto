reflex roll for taking cover after round end?
consider having guns w/out clip or magazine only partially reload?
introduce overpenetration

first need to summarize how eureka ranged combat works

rolling to hit is a firearms skill check w/ a full success needed for a hit

Firearms/Reflex roll needed for reloads?

firearm basics
when firing a gun a firearms roll is made for each individual shot

a full success hits the target, a partial success or failure misses the target

all guns deal 4 penetrative damage per shot

a firearms roll is made to reload (maybe change this to a reflex roll?)

a full success allows for a reload and then an action
partial success allows for a reload that takes a full turn
failure is two turns spent reloading

shots at extremely close range against targets not resisting
shots at long range against still or slow moving targets is +3


advanced firearms rolls
all gun characteristics like ammo capacity etc should be based on real
characteristics

Stabilization
roll to keep yr aim steady while quickly firing multiple shots
rolled the first time a character fires multiple shots in one round
make a firearms or athletics roll (whichever is higher)

on a full success there is no penalty to rolls to hit
on a partial success all shots for the round have a -1 penalty
on a failure all shots for the round have a -2 penalty

Woo Roll
Bullets always hit something!
if a shot is not a full success roll 1d6
on a 3 or higher it will hit something that somehow benefits the shooter
on 2 or lower it'll hit something that doesn't benefit the shooter like

If a shot is a partial success rol the woo roll normally
if it was a failure subtract -2
or do coin flip/d2/odds or evens to determine good or bad

affect obvious things in the room first

full success still needed to hit elements of the environment intentionally

Woo Roll Tables
Used for when there aren't obvious objects in the environment that could be hit

Positive Woo Roll Table
2: Hits the target as if it's a full success
3. hits target's weapons and disarms them without destroying the weapon
4. hits and destroys the target weapon
5. hits the targets headgear and knocks it off/damages it. removes armor provided by a helmet
6.Bullet strikes ground near target's foot -1 morale or gunfight composure roll
7. Hits target's body armor and causes 2 superficial damage if they have armor if not
deal 4 superficial damage from a limb shot
8. bullet hits or destroys ammo on the targets body -1 morale or gunfight composure (consider replacing with limbshot roll instead)
9. bullet hits and destroys magazine or ammo in targets but leaves weapon intact -1 morale or gunfight composure
(consider replacing with limbshit roll from 7)
10. same as 8
11. bullet richocets and hits an enemy the shooter wasn't aiming at for 1/2 dmg
12. bullet ricochets and hits the target for half damage

Negative Woo Roll Table
2. bullet ricochets and hits shooter for half damage
3. Bullet richochets and hits ally for half damage
4. shooter's gun explosively malfunctions causing shooter 2 penetrative damage
5. shooter's gun jams or otherwise malfunctions
6. the shooter's grip slips and they lose their grip on the gun dropping it
7. the shooter's grip slips causing them to have a -1 penalty next time they shoot (entire turn)
8. smoke and powder residue blows back in shooter's face causing them a -2 penalty next time they shoot
9. gun doesn't actually fire
10. shooter's gun malfunctions so poorly that proper repair will be required before it functions next (consider more rare)
11. shooter's gun explosively malfunctions causing 4 penetrative damage (consider making more rare)
12. runaway firing (see later)

Firing Options
single bullet: make a firearms roll. on full success the shot hits the intended target
	on a partial sucess make a woo roll. on a failure make a woo roll with a -2 modifier
two round burst: any semiautomatic gun can do this. if a firearm in use does not have a stock first make a stabilization roll
	then make two separate firearms rolls as single bullet

three round burst: any semiautomatic gun can do this. make a stabilization roll if the firearm
	doesn't have a stock. Attack can be made on up to 3 targets (consider making this perk only)
	make three separate firearms rolls.

Fully automatic fire: usable by full auto capable weapons. Make a stabilization roll even if the firearm has a stock
	then make 4-12 firearms rolls potentially against multiple targets with a perk. when firing more than 3 at once
	firearms checks are made with d12's instead of 2d6's. on a d12 1 represents a failure and a 12
	represents a full success regardless of modifiers
