TODO List

HIGH PRIORITY


	- cluster all render systems in the systems/mod
	- need to be able to use <> for level navigation
	- rename overworld to worldmap, location to localmap, locations to localmaps, and map(s) to mapscreen(s)
	- finalize layout for ranged combat system after going through eureka rules and doing pseudocode
MEDIUM PRIORITY

	- develop a better way of tracking the overworld/localworld split (maybe have everything just reference the controlstate?? use less state trackers)
	- add a UI state for traveling the overworld that will have relevant information on the side.
	- Look at UI Rendering in general

LOW PRIORITY
	- make it so NPCs/entities will move around the worldmap too and move between locations
	- add skills
	- add ranged combat
	- add functionality for reading spawns from a text file
	- add water management element that drains when you travel/according to amount of turns (it'll be once every 24 hours)
	- condsider changing examining component name to "BeingExamined"
	- implement a pallete system for locations so that a core palette of a tiles can represent a variety of environments
	- work out basic interaction system
	
	RANGED_COMBAT
		- Figure out a dodging system
COMPLETED TASKS
	- refactor components [remember to keep doing this as the amount of components grow and grow]
	- add support for shift and control to enable more advanced controls [ended up not combining these into a tuple cuz that's stupid]
	- refactor player input into its own systems module
	- turn the maps into a fixed array instead of a vector
	- turn list of locations to array accessed by the locationID enum cast as a usize
	- rewrite ai systems to be functional (and hopefully to be better) [all original AI systems are working as they did before]
	- throw some basic enemies in the dungeon [added random spawns in level 2 of the first dungeon]
