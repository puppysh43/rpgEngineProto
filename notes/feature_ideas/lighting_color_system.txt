the game engine will have support for a light system that will be used for stealth and calculating FOV
Dynamic color type will be used for the render component
 - a dynamic color type is simply a tuple of 3 colors and will consist of constants
 - the actual color can be accessed with methods like .bright() .dim() .dark()
 - this will allow objects to be given colors that change w/ the lighting
Light system
 - light system will be used to make things prettier/add additional depth to stealth gameplay
 - same system for casting an FOV will be used for light
 - each light source will increase in a shadowcast circle around it the light level of the mapscreen (if it has a lighting component)
 - if Z level is 0 or over its light level will be effected by the time of day
 - for indoor outdoor lighting consider having it be based on outdoor vs indoor floor types 
(maybe for ease of use in map editor or something outdoor floors will be set w/ a period and indoor w/ the centered dot)
that way buildings on ground level and above will NOT be well lit
maybe windows can be light sources determined by time of day
each mapscreen will have an array of light levels to be updated by the lighting system each tick (only for active mapscreen but maybe global?)

consider having each localmap have its own pallete for tiletypes (such as outdoor floors, thin walls, thick walls, etc)
(no need to do bitmasking b/c its happening in tiled?)
