Skills
	- skills will be sorted into broad categories and each category will have primary and secondary skills
		primary and secondary skills don't differ mechanically but they're used to mark to the player
		which skills are used to solve core gameplay encounters and which ones are useful but not critical
		(ex. it helps to have outdoorsman, medicine, or athletics, but it's not gonna help you deal w/ enemies)
	- skills can go from -5 to 5
	- make failure of a skill check sometimes more punishing than choosing the non-skillcheck option
	- maybe add a cap on how much variance you can have/how high you can go at first for balance reasons (probably yes to maximum of 3 at first with)
